---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher  
- pip (Python package installer)

Check your Python version:

python --version
```

## Installing via pip

The easiest way to install Payman is via PyPI:

```

Or, if you want the latest development version, install directly from GitHub:

```

## (Optional) Using a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```
